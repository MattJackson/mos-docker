# mos15 display test runbook

Walk through this every time you deploy a new `mos15-patcher` or `QEMUDisplayPatcher` build. Each step has a clear pass signal, a clear fail signal, and what to do when it fails.

---

## 0. Prerequisites (one-time setup)

- **Auto-login on the VM.** CoreGraphics APIs (the ones `list-modes` / `displayplacer` call) need a console-logged-in user bootstrap. Without it, `CGGetOnlineDisplayList` returns 0 and the whole observability layer goes dark.
  - Check: `ssh matthew@10.1.7.20 who` — expect `matthew console <date>`
  - Enable: `sudo sysadminctl -autologin set -userName <user> -password <pw>` (run on the VM, once)
- **Compile the `list-modes` helper** on the host mac (VM doesn't ship Xcode CLT):
  ```bash
  cd tests && clang -arch x86_64 -mmacosx-version-min=10.15 \
      -framework Foundation -framework CoreGraphics -framework CoreVideo \
      list-modes.m -o list-modes
  ```

---

## 1. Build + deploy

Always from `/Users/mjackson/docker-macos`:
```bash
# (if mos15-patcher changed)
cd /Users/mjackson/mos15-patcher && rm -f build/*.o && \
    KERN_SDK=/Users/mjackson/docker-macos/kexts/deps/MacKernelSDK ./build.sh
cp -R build/mos15-patcher.kext /Users/mjackson/docker-macos/kexts/deps/

# always
cd /Users/mjackson/docker-macos/kexts/QEMUDisplayPatcher && rm -rf build && ./build.sh
cd /Users/mjackson/docker-macos && ./build-mos15-img.sh && ./deploy.sh
```

Expected: `==> Starting macos-macos-1` and an image md5 printed.

**If build fails:** check the build.sh output for `error:` lines — compile errors are almost always in `patcher.cpp` or the macro expansion from `mos15_patcher.h`.

---

## 2. Boot reaches login / desktop

```bash
ssh docker "sudo docker logs --tail 500 macos-macos-1 2>&1" | grep -E "loginwindow|panic"
```

**Pass:** at least one line matching `loginwindow`, no `panic`.
**Fail modes:**
- `panic` — kernel trap during boot. Full backtrace earlier in the log. Most common cause: bad paramSig in a route, or vtable offset math wrong. Revert last change and bisect.
- no `loginwindow` line after 3+ minutes — hang during kext matching or userspace init. Scan for the last service to report start to find where it stuck.

---

## 3. mos15-patcher + QDP loaded

```bash
ssh docker "sudo docker logs --tail 3000 macos-macos-1 2>&1" | grep -E "^(mp:|QDP:)"
```

**Expected:**
```
mp:start: mos15-patcher starting
mp:start: cached N already-loaded kexts
QDP: starting (mos15-patcher edition)
mp:notify: registered publish notification for IONDRVFramebuffer (36 routes pending)
QDP: mp_route_on_publish returned 0 (n=36 routes)
```

If `mp:start` missing: kext didn't load. Check `kextload` errors in docker logs, and that `kexts/deps/mos15-patcher.kext` made it into the image (`build-mos15-img.sh` logs `Copying built kexts`).

If `QDP: starting` missing but mp:start ran: QDP.kext didn't load. Usually `OSBundleLibraries` version mismatch in Info.plist.

---

## 4. Hook coverage — 24/24 methods patched, 0 gaps

```bash
ssh matthew@10.1.7.20 "ioreg -c IONDRVFramebuffer -l 2>/dev/null" | grep -E '"MP[A-Z]'
```

**Expected (today, as of 2026-04-19 — post connectFlags fix):**
```
"MPMethodsHooked"    = 24
"MPMethodsMissing"   = 0
"MPMethodGaps"       = ()
"MPMethodsTotal"     = 24
"MPStatus"           = "Pf Pf Pf Pf Pf Pf PX PX PX PX PX PX PX Pf PX Pf Pf Pf Pf Pf Pf Pf Pf Pu "
"MPRoutesPatched"    = 24
```

The 24 method pairs covered (first = IONDRVFramebuffer override, second = IOFramebuffer base): enableController, hasDDCConnect, getDDCBlock, setGammaTable, getVRAMRange, setAttributeForConnection, getApertureRange, getPixelFormats, getDisplayModeCount, getDisplayModes, getInformationForDisplayMode, getPixelInformation, getCurrentDisplayMode, setDisplayMode, getPixelFormatsForDisplayMode, getTimingInfoForDisplayMode, getConnectionCount, setupForCurrentConfig, **getAttribute, getAttributeForConnection, registerForInterruptType, unregisterInterrupt, setInterruptState, connectFlags**.

**Status-char legend** (`MPStatus`, one pair per method, derived/base):
| char | meaning |
|------|---------|
| `P` | Primary kext resolved, vtable slot patched ✓ |
| `F` | Fallback kext (IOGraphicsFamily) resolved, patched ✓ |
| `u` | Primary resolved but slot already taken — harmless, other pair won |
| `f` | Fallback resolved but slot taken — harmless |
| `X` | Not resolved anywhere — intentional for pure-virtual base methods |

**A method pair is "hooked" if at least one of its two routes is `P` or `F`.** A gap is when both are `u/f/X`.

**If `MPMethodsMissing > 0`:** look at `MPMethodGaps` for the mangled names. Common causes:
- Typedef mis-mangle (param type is a typedef for something that mangles differently) — use `MP_ROUTE_PAIR_SIG` with explicit sig instead
- Method is overloaded — use `MP_ROUTE_PAIR_SIG` to disambiguate
- Symbol stripped from the kext — verify via `nm | grep <mangled>` on the kext binary

---

## 5. EDID identity — real iMac20,1 bytes in IOKit

```bash
ssh matthew@10.1.7.20 "ioreg -l 2>/dev/null" | grep -E '"DisplayProductID"|"DisplayVendorID"|"IODisplayEDID"' | head -3
```

**Expected:**
```
"DisplayProductID" = 44593      (0xAE31 — iMac20,1)
"DisplayVendorID"  = 1552       (0x0610 — Apple PnP "APP")
"IODisplayEDID"    = <00ffffffffffff00061031ae... 256 bytes ...44>
```

EDID length is 256 bytes (2 blocks). If only 128 bytes: `patchedGetDDCBlock`'s multi-block dispatch broke.

If VendorID != 1552: the old fabricated EDID is being served — our `imac20_edid_block0` didn't get compiled in. Rebuild QDP and redeploy.

---

## 6. Every patched hook actually fires

```bash
ssh docker "sudo docker logs --tail 3000 macos-macos-1 2>&1" | grep "^QDP:.*called" | sort -u
```

**Expected (at minimum):**
```
QDP: enableController -> 0x0 (SMC+VRAM=256MB)
QDP: hasDDCConnect called -> true
QDP: getDDCBlock called bn=1 bt=0
QDP: getDisplayModeCount called -> 8
QDP: getDisplayModes called (n=8)
QDP: getInformationForDisplayMode called mode=1
```

These prove the vtable swap is effective — macOS calls into our replacements.

**If any hook above is missing:** our swap happens too late for that call path, OR macOS reaches that functionality via a different IOKit class. **This is the fingerprint we check.**

Hooks that commonly don't fire (still not a failure — they're for post-init state changes):
- `setupForCurrentConfig` — only runs on reconfig events; may not fire on a clean boot
- `setDisplayMode` — only when user changes resolution
- `getTimingInfoForDisplayMode`, `getPixelInformation` — may or may not be consulted depending on framebuffer init path

---

## 7. CoreGraphics sees every mode we advertise

```bash
./tests/verify-modes.sh
```

**Expected:**
```
✓ mode visible in CoreGraphics: 1920x1080
✓ mode visible in CoreGraphics: 2560x1440
✓ mode visible in CoreGraphics: 5120x2880
✓ mode visible in CoreGraphics: 3840x2160
✓ mode visible in CoreGraphics: 3008x1692
✓ mode visible in CoreGraphics: 2048x1152
✓ mode visible in CoreGraphics: 1680x945
✓ mode visible in CoreGraphics: 1280x720
```

**State as of 2026-04-19 (post connectFlags fix): 7/8 visible.** The 5120×2880 mode is blocked upstream by QEMU's vmware-svga device model (max resolution is ~3840×2160) — not fixable in QDP. `tests/verify-modes.sh` tracks this as `EXPECTED_MODES_UPSTREAM_BLOCKED` and flags if the upstream block ever lifts.

Root cause of the earlier filtering (fixed): IONDRVFramebuffer's default `connectFlags(ci, modeID, *flags)` delegates to the NDRV driver. NDRV didn't recognize our custom mode IDs and returned `0`/`NeverShow`, so macOS hid them. Patched to return `kDisplayModeValidFlag | kDisplayModeSafeFlag` for every advertised mode.

---

## 8. VRAM + current display state

```bash
ssh matthew@10.1.7.20 "system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType"
ssh matthew@10.1.7.20 "ioreg -c IONDRVFramebuffer -l | grep -E 'IOFBCurrentPixelCount|IOFBMemorySize'"
```

**Expected:**
```
VRAM (Total): 256 MB
Vendor ID: 0x15ad    (VMware SVGA — this is the underlying device, not the EDID)

"IOFBMemorySize"        = 268435456     (256 MB)
"IOFBCurrentPixelCount" = 2073600       (1920×1080)
```

If VRAM shows 7 MB: `patchedEnableController`/`patchedSetupForCurrentConfig`'s `setProperty("IOFBMemorySize", ...)` isn't landing. Verify `kIOPCIConfigBaseAddress1` read is returning the 256 MB BAR.

---

## 9. 20-boot consistency (ship gate)

```bash
./kexts/QEMUDisplayPatcher/test-20.sh
```

Runs the whole stack 20 times in a row. Counts pass/fail.

**Ship gate:** 20/20 pass. Anything less = flakiness = do not archive `lilu-mos15` yet.

## Quick reference — where each signal comes from

| Signal | Source | Read with |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Kext loaded | serial console (docker logs) | `grep "mp:start\|QDP: starting"` |
| Routes registered | serial console | `grep "mp_route_on_publish"` |
| Per-method coverage | kernel ioreg property | `ioreg \| grep MPMethod` |
| Per-route status | kernel ioreg property | `ioreg \| grep MPStatus` |
| Hook fire evidence | serial console + ioreg counters | `grep "QDP:.*called"` + `QDPCallCounts` |
| Mode list as userspace sees it | CoreGraphics via `list-modes` | `launchctl asuser 501 /tmp/list-modes` |
| Current resolution | kernel ioreg | `ioreg \| grep IOFBCurrentPixelCount` |
| EDID bytes as delivered | kernel ioreg | `ioreg \| grep IODisplayEDID` |
| EDID vendor/product | kernel ioreg | `ioreg \| grep DisplayVendorID` |

Three independent observation points (serial log, kernel ioreg, userspace CG) — if a signal only shows in one of the three, that's itself informative (tells you which layer the breakdown is at).
